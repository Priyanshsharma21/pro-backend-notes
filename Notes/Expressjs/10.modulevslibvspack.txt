Modules in node are reusable chubk of code, its a unit of code that we can reuse in our application. we can import and exirt this code and use it whenever we need it.
This makes code reusablity and make app more loght weight.
It help to write structured code.

Modules provide a way to divide a software system into smaller, manageable parts. 
They can contain variables, functions, classes, or other code elements.
Modules help in achieving modular programming, which promotes separation of concerns and allows developers to work on different modules independently. Some benefits of using modules include code reusability, encapsulation, and improved code organization.



Types of Modules:

!File-based Modules:
This type of module is based on organizing code into separate files. Each file represents a module containing related functionality. Programming languages like JavaScript (Node.js), Python, and Java commonly use file-based modules. These modules can be imported or included in other files to access their contents.

!Library Modules:
Library modules are collections of related functions, classes, or components that provide specific functionality. They are designed to be reusable and can be shared across multiple projects. Libraries often come with their own API and documentation. Examples include JavaScript libraries like React, Python libraries like NumPy, and Java libraries like Apache Commons.

!Framework Modules: 
Frameworks are sets of libraries, tools, and conventions that provide a foundation for building applications. Frameworks usually consist of multiple modules that work together to provide a complete development environment. Framework modules often have predefined structures and conventions that developers need to follow. Examples include Express.js and Django, which are web application frameworks.

!Built-in Modules:
Some programming languages provide built-in or standard modules that come bundled with the language itself. These modules offer essential functionality and can be accessed without additional installation or configuration. Built-in modules often cover common tasks such as file I/O, networking, date/time operations, and mathematical operations. Examples include the os module in Python or the http module in Node.js.

!Package Modules:
Package modules are used in package management systems and allow developers to distribute and install code packages easily. These modules typically include the necessary files, configuration, and metadata required for proper installation and usage. Examples include npm packages in Node.js, pip packages in Python, or Maven packages in Java.

It's worth noting that the specific terminology and implementation of modules may vary depending on the programming language and ecosystem being used. However, the core idea behind modules remains consistent: organizing code into logical units to improve maintainability and reusability.
