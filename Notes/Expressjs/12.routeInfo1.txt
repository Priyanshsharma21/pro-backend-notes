!Handling different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE):

In Express.js, you can handle different HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE using the corresponding methods provided by the Express application object (app). 

*For example:
app.get(route, handler): Handles HTTP GET requests.
app.post(route, handler): Handles HTTP POST requests.
app.put(route, handler): Handles HTTP PUT requests.
app.delete(route, handler): Handles HTTP DELETE requests.

You specify the route (URL pattern) and the corresponding route handler function for each HTTP method. When a request matches the specified route and HTTP method, Express invokes the corresponding route handler to handle the request.

!Defining routes and route parameters:

Routes in Express define the URL patterns that the application should respond to. Routes can be simple strings or can contain route parameters, which are dynamic segments of the URL. Route parameters are denoted by a colon followed by the parameter name.
For example:

/users: Matches requests to the "/users" URL.
/users/:id: Matches requests to URLs like "/users/123" or "/users/abc", where ":id" can be any value.
Route parameters are accessible in route handlers through the req.params object. For example, if the route is /users/:id, you can access the value of :id using req.params.id in the corresponding route handler.

!Implementing route handlers and middleware functions:
Route handlers are functions that are executed when a matching route is found. They receive the req (request) and res (response) objects, allowing you to access and manipulate the request and send a response back to the client.
For example:

javascript
Copy code
app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const userId = req.params.id;
  * Handle the request and send the response
});
Middleware functions, as mentioned earlier, have access to the req, res, and next objects. They can perform operations on the request or response objects and then call next() to pass control to the next middleware in the stack.

!Routing with Express Router:
Express Router allows you to modularize and organize your routes into separate files or modules. You can create an instance of the Express Router using express.Router(), define routes on it, and then mount it on the main application using app.use().
Here's an example:


const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

router.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  * Handle the request for /users route
});

router.post('/users', (req, res) => {
  * Handle the request for creating a new user
});

* Mount the router on the main application
app.use('/api', router);
In this example, the routes defined in the router will be prefixed with '/api'. For example, the GET route for users will be accessed as '/api/users'.

!Request and Response Handling:
The req (request) object represents the HTTP request received by the server, and the res (response) object allows you to send a response back to the client. These objects provide various methods and properties for handling the request and response.
For example, you can use req.query to access query parameters, req.body to access the request body (requires body-parser middleware), and res.send() or res.json() to send a response to the client.

The request and response objects also have additional properties and methods to access headers, cookies, session data, and more, enabling you to handle and process incoming requests and send appropriate responses.
