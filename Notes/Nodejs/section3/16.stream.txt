Streamm is a sequence of data moved from one point to another over time.
Stream just allow us to work with chunks rather than large data.
Ex - Stream of files moved from one computer to another computer.

Work with data in chunks instead of wating for the entire data to be available at once.


If we are transfaring content from file a to b you dont have to wait for entire file A content to be saved in temprory memnry before moving it into fileB.

Instead content transfter in chunks.

There are 4 types of streams - 
Readable - From Which we can read data.
Writable - To which we can write data.
Duplex - Both Readable and Writable.
Transform - Can Modify or transform data that is written and read.
