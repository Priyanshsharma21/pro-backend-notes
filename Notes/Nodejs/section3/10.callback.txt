In javascript functions are first class objects.
A function can be pass as argument to another function.
An function can be return as value from another function.

ex - 

const greet = (name)=>{
    console.log(`Hello ${name}`)
}

const higherOrderFunction = (callback)=>{
    const name = "vishwas"

    callback(name)
}

higherOrderFunction(greet)


//* Here greetVishwas is a function which accepts another function as argumenet.
//* Any function which is passes as argument to another function is called callback function.
//* function which accepts function as argm and return function is Higher order function

Callbackes are of two type - 
1. Sync
2. Async.

Sync - Callback which is execute immidiatly is synv.

Ex - greet here is sync callback function.
Practical example - a callback function that passed to salt, map or filter is sync callback function.

Async - A callback that is often used to continue or resume code execution after an async operation has completed.
Most of the modules have ths nature, which stop blocking of the execiiton. API request, fetching data from DB.

Ex - addEventListners('click' callback) - when user click then this function triggered.
Hence the execution is delayed till user click.

Delay the execution until some time or event is async callback.
