How Web Works - 
Computer connected to internet are called clients and servers.

Client are - Internet connected devices such as (thick)computers or mobiles phones along with (thin)web browsers

Servers - computer that stores web pages sites or apps.



When we send request (http) from client to server then server downloads that request process it and send response to client and client show it to user.

This is client server model.

!But what format ?

HTTP = Hyper text transfer protocol.
This protocol defines a format for clients and server to speak to each other.
Client sends HTTP request and server responds with HTTP response.

Now in node we can make server using HTTP using HTTP library.
Nodejs has access to OS functionality like networking.
Node has event loop to run task async and is perfect to create web servers. and handle large volume of data.

HTTP module allow us to make web server which follow HTTP to transfer data
