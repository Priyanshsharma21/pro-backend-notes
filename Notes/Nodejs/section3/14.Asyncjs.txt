JS is Sync, Blocking, Single threaded languange.

Sync - Means Code executes top to bottom, left to right. One line at a time.
If we havetwo function then it will execute 1st then secone.


Blocking - Until one task completes it will not proceed to second task.

Single Threaded - Thread(process) that JS programe use to run a task.
Each thread can do one task at a time.

Multi thread - Execute multiple task at a time.

This model create lot's of problem.

Ex - We are fetching data from database. Now our database is most probaible present in other continent or country. This can take lot's of time, even 10 sec is too much.
And when this is completed then the next line executes. So we have to wait for this task.
And we can't proceed other task until that.
We want Non Blocking, and async behavious
This is possible because of Nodejs and Browser in fe
So Single JS is not enough for that. we need new pieces outside js to do this task.

In Frontend Broweser comes into play. Backend Node comes into play.

Web Browser and Nodejs allow us to make function that will be involked when something happens, some events. Not sync, async.

Like when user click on something then something happens. setTimeout, setInterval, addEventListners, callback, promises,async-await.
