Pipe - A pipe which connects tank to kitchen sink.

Pipe in Nodejs takes Readable stream and connects it to writable stream.


const readableStream = fs.createReadStream("./demo.txt", {
    encoding: "utf-8",
    highWaterMark: 2 // now the size of buffer is 2 and it reads 2 byts at a time
})

const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream("./file2.txt");

readableStream.pipe(writableStream)
