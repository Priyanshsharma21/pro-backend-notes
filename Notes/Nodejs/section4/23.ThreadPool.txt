 Callback function will be run when proces completes
  this definatly dont take long time - In this example - all the three execution run in parall and run inside the libuv thread pool.

 Ex - crypto.pbkf3, fs.readFile all this runs in libuv seprate pool.
  it means is there are 3 task then 3 threads are there - so how many threads are there in toal.


If we make Maxcall to 5 then we notice that 4 executes with same time which is 300 around but 5th one takes twice time then other

it means in threat pool of libuv we have 4 threads, once 1st complete and then 5th starts.

 can we increase the threadpool size.
  we can ise process.env.UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE=5 roc then size increase


 Now let's say My computer PC have 8 cores - 2 of them are efficiency cores.


 Now I have main thread of JS, then I have Libuv - threadpool. if I have one task then it will execute in 1st core - in lets say - 200ms, Now if I change the calls and size to 8 then each thread takes one thread to execute - this will also takes 200ms.

 Now we have 16 calls hence 16 has to juggle in 8 cores so it takes double time - 400ms
