At time of nodejs was created there was no build in module system in js.
 Nodejs default to commonjs as its module system.
ES modules is ECMA script std for modules
 In 2015 after es6, js standrized to module system as part of language, till 2015 now react is in use and it follow module system as

 This is called ES module.

 We use mjs file extention for es module.

 In ES6 Now we can use .\


 import add from './add'; 
 import fs from 'fs'; 


 in export also we can do default and name exports.

 Default 

 const add = (a,b)=>{
    return a+b
 }

 const sub = (a,b)=>{
    return a-b
 }

 export default {add,sub}


 and then we can
 import Math from './math.js';
 Math.add(1,3)
 Math.sub(1,3)



 we can use name export - 

 export const add = (a,b)=>{
    return a+b
 }

 export const sub = (a,b)=>{
    return a-b
 }

import { add, sub } from './Math.js'
