JSON - javascript object notation.
A data interchange format commonly used with web servers.

Like JS object but key is string.

When you import a JSON file and use it then require will parse it to js object.

JS will find js file first and then other like json or other.
So use extention also.


!Watchmode - It is like Nodemon.
node --watch index.js - and whenver when we make chage and save then it will restart the server.
