In CSS, the display property is used to define how an element should be displayed on the web page. Two of the most common values for the display property are block and inline.

A block-level element takes up the full width of its parent container and creates a new line after the element. Examples of block-level elements include <div>, <p>, <h1>-<h6>, and <ul>. By default, block-level elements are stacked vertically on top of each other, but their positioning can be changed with CSS properties such as float, position, and display.

An inline-level element only takes up as much width as its content requires and does not create a new line after the element. Examples of inline-level elements include <span>, <a>, <img>, and <strong>. Inline-level elements can be styled with CSS properties such as padding, border, and background-color, but their positioning cannot be changed with properties like float or position.

It is also worth noting that some elements, such as <input> and <button>, have a default display value of inline-block, which is a combination of both block and inline display properties. An inline-block element behaves like an inline element in terms of not taking up the full width of its parent container and not creating a new line after the element, but it can also be styled with properties that are typically reserved for block-level elements, such as width, height, and margin.

Here is an example of how the display property can be used to change the behavior of an element:

css
Copy code
/* Make all <p> elements block-level */
p {
  display: block;
}

/* Make all <a> elements inline-level */
a {
  display: inline;
}
In summary, the display property in CSS allows developers to control how an element is displayed on the web page, with block and inline being two of the most common values used to define the layout of content on a web page.

Example of inline block

Sure! Here's an example of an inline-block element:

HTML:

html
Copy code
<div class="example">
  <button>Click me!</button>
</div>
CSS:

css
Copy code
.example {
  border: 1px solid black;
  padding: 10px;
  display: inline-block;
}
In this example, we have a <div> element with a class of "example" that contains a <button> element. We've applied some basic styling to the <div> element using CSS, including a 1px solid black border and 10px of padding on all sides.

The key part of this example is the display: inline-block; property applied to the <div> element. This causes the <div> element to behave like an inline element in terms of not taking up the full width of its parent container and not creating a new line after the element, but also allows it to be styled with properties that are typically reserved for block-level elements, such as width, height, and margin.

The end result is a button that is contained within a box with a border and padding, but the box does not take up the full width of its parent container and does not create a new line after the button.
